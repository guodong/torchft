# Testing

Whenever you make a new change, you should test that change.

The test should be simple, based on the unittest framework.

If there are existing tests, build on top of that test file. Else, create a new one.

When you run the unittests, run python -m unitest -v {test_module_path (in the form of a.b.c)}
